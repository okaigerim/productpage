        <h2>History</h2>

        <section id="playing-card-business">
          <h3>1889–1932: Origin as a Playing Card Business</h3>
          <p>
            Founded in 1889 as Nintendo Karuta by Fusajiro Yamauchi in Kyoto,
            Japan, Nintendo began by crafting traditional Japanese playing
            cards, especially hanafuda. The company's name, often interpreted as
            "leave luck to heaven," underscored its early direction. Despite
            obstacles, including catering to a niche market and dealing with
            manufacturing complexities, Nintendo's success stemmed from
            producing accessible, lower-quality cards named Tengu. Over time,
            the company expanded globally and secured a pivotal partnership with
            Japan Tobacco in 1907, propelling it to become Japan's leading
            playing card business by 1929.

          <h3>1933–1968: Incorportation, expansion, and diversification</h3>
          <p>
            From 1933 to 1968, Nintendo underwent significant transformations
            and expansions. The company evolved from a general partnership named
            Yamauchi Nintendo & Co., Ltd., establishing a new corporate
            headquarters in 1933. Hiroshi Yamauchi took over as president in
            1950, introducing pivotal changes such as mass-producing plastic
            playing cards and automating production. Collaborating with The Walt
            Disney Company in 1959, Nintendo entered the children's market and
            diversified its offerings, marking its transition into manufacturing
            games alongside playing cards.

          <h3>1969–1972: Classic and electronic toys</h3>
          <p>
            Between 1969 and 1972, Nintendo made significant strides in research
            and development under the leadership of Hiroshi Yamauchi. The
            company established a dedicated department for electronic devices,
            led by Gunpei Yokoi, resulting in the creation of popular classic
            tabletop games such as chess, shogi, go, and mahjong. A pivotal
            moment came in 1970 with the release of Japan's first electronic
            toy, the Beam Gun, followed by successful collaborations with
            Magnavox for light gun controllers and the launch of innovative toys
            like the Ultra Hand and Ultra Machine.

          <h3>2017 - Present days</h3>
          <p>
            In the period spanning from 2017 to the present, Nintendo's
            influence on the gaming industry continued to evolve. The Nintendo
            Switch, a hybrid console combining home and handheld gaming, was
            released in 2017, featuring innovative Joy-Con controllers and a
            diverse game library from third-party developers. The release of the
            Nintendo Labo line in 2018 brought unique cardboard accessories to
            interact with the Switch. Leadership changes saw Shuntaro Furukawa
            becoming the company president in 2018, and in 2019, Doug Bowser
            taking over as the president of Nintendo of America. Strategic
            alliances with Tencent expanded Nintendo's presence in China in
            2019. The company's expansion also extended beyond gaming, with the
            opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan in 2021
            and the production of animated projects, including the highly
            successful Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023.
